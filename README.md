# chatbot-no-ai

I am attempting to create a chatbot that learns but doesn't use things like neural networks, just regular boring code. Also this is my first time using GitHub, so please be nice!

## Notes

I realise that this already exists, but I just want to challenge myself. Also, I'm putting it on GitHub because it's better than Google Drive for this type of thing.
